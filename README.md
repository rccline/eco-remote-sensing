## Physalia-courses.org [*Introduction to Ecological Remote Sensing in R*](https://www.physalia-courses.org/courses-workshops/remote-sensing-in-r/) presented by Professor Duccio Rocchini, *Studiorum Universita de Bologna*. 2022.  


Physalia Eco Remote Sensing course presented by Duccio Rocchini  
The course covers ecological remote sensing of problems related to planetary changes with Landsat data.  Output will be reported using LaTeX scripting.
Lectures and scripting analyzing DVI and NDVI with examples of remote sensing and multitemporal analysis techniques.  
Unsupervised image classification using kmeans sampling is introduced using RSToolbox.
